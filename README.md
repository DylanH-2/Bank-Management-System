# Bank-Managment-System
A mini programming project I built in C (the header, main, and banking file), this Bank Management System uses several concepts and techniques I've learned. Designed with simplicity, it simulates basic banking app operations through a command-line.

# Features
* Security PIN system: Every account is protected with a user-selected PIN that can always be changed
* Memory allocation: Accounts are managed using linked lists and techniques for efficiency
* Transaction history: Tracks deposits and withdrawals with a history log
* Account actions:
    * Deposit and withdraw
    * Edit account details
    * Delete account
    * Create new accounts

 # Project Structure
 * main.c: Handles the menu and user interactions
 * banking.c: Holds all the main functions
 * bankinghead.h: Header file containing all the libraries, function declarations, and data structures

# Why I made this
 * I wanted to make a C program from the start for fun and reinforce important concepts
